# Working Patterns & Preferences

## Code Style Preferences
- **Python**: Type hints always, Google-style docstrings, FastAPI patterns
- **SQL**: Uppercase keywords, snake_case names, explicit indexes
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, interfaces over types, React hooks patterns
- **Git**: Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:)

## Communication Preferences
- **Technical Depth**: ADAPTIVE - Start with clear explanations for a learning developer. Increase complexity as familiarity with concepts is demonstrated. Watch for signals of understanding or confusion.
- **Code Examples**: Show working code with inline comments initially. Reduce explanation density as patterns become familiar.
- **Decision Making**: Present options in accessible language, gradually introduce more technical considerations as expertise grows
- **Progress Updates**: Visual indicators (‚úÖ ‚è≥ ‚ùå) and simple status summaries
- **Learning Style**: Break complex topics into steps initially, accelerate pace based on comprehension signals
- **Adaptation Signals**: 
  - ‚úÖ Understanding shown: Move faster, less explanation needed
  - ‚ùì Questions asked: Slow down, provide more context
  - üîÑ Repetition needed: Maintain current level, reinforce concepts

## Discovered Patterns
*This section will grow as we learn what works best*

### Environment Management
- **Virtual Environment**: ALWAYS activate venv before running Python in backend/
  ```bash
  cd /Users/conor.leary/dev/asmis/backend && source venv/bin/activate && python <script>
  ```
- **Critical Symptoms of Missing venv**:
  - `ModuleNotFoundError` for installed packages (e.g., networkx)
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set` (env file not loaded)
  - Tests fail with import/dependency errors
- **Quick Diagnostic**: `which python3` should show `/backend/venv/bin/python3`
- **User Feedback**: Has corrected this multiple times - MUST remember venv activation
- **Pattern**: Always run tests with `source venv/bin/activate &&` prefix

### Testing Best Practices
- **Smart API Testing**: Use fake API keys for integration testing to validate code structure without API costs
  ```python
  # ‚úÖ GOOD: Integration testing with fake key
  agent = SomeAgent('test-key')
  try:
      result = await agent.process(data)
  except Exception as e:
      if '401' in str(e) or 'authentication' in str(e):
          print('‚úÖ Integration validated - code structure correct')
      else:
          print(f'‚ùå Code issue: {e}')
  ```
- **When to use fake keys**: Integration testing, CI/CD, development iteration
- **When to use real keys**: End-to-end validation, quality assurance, demos
- **Benefits**: Cost efficiency, speed, reliability, security
- **User Insight**: "This should be a best practice going forward"

### Documentation Best Practices
- **Proactive Pattern Recognition**: AI should intelligently identify best practices during work, not just wait for user identification
- **Auto-Documentation Triggers**:
  - Solving a problem that could recur
  - Discovering an efficient workflow or approach
  - Learning from mistakes or corrections
  - Identifying reusable code patterns or architecture decisions
  - User feedback that reveals improvement opportunities
- **Documentation Workflow**:
  1. **Recognize**: Identify pattern/practice worth capturing
  2. **Assess**: Determine if it's reusable/valuable
  3. **Ask if Uncertain**: "Should I document this pattern for future use?"
  4. **Document**: Update appropriate project file immediately
  5. **Validate**: Ensure it's accessible for future reference
- **Persistent Documentation**: Always update `.ai/WORKING_PATTERNS.md` for reusable patterns
  ```
  ‚ùå BAD: "That's a great pattern! [explains in response only]"
  ‚úÖ GOOD: "Let me document this pattern..." [actually updates file]
  ```
- **Location Strategy**: 
  - `.ai/WORKING_PATTERNS.md` - Discovered best practices and user insights
  - `track_progress/` - Session-specific progress and context
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Project intelligence system configuration
- **User Feedback Signals**: "Where did you document?" indicates failed documentation
- **Documentation Validation**: If you can't reference it later from a file, it wasn't properly documented

### Feature Enhancement Capture Pattern
- **Enhancement Ideas**: Capture in `.project_memory/intelligence/ENHANCEMENT_ROADMAP.md`, NOT in WORKING_PATTERNS.md
- **Individual Features**: Create detailed docs in appropriate directories (e.g., `app/intelligence/feature_name_enhancement.md`)
- **Todo Integration**: Add as categorized pending tasks with appropriate priority
- **Working Patterns**: Focus on HOW we work, not WHAT features to build

### Todo List Organization Pattern
- **Categorized Structure**: Use prefixes for clarity
  - `COMPLETED:` - Major completed work (keep for context)
  - `HIGH PRIORITY:` - Next immediate work
  - `MEDIUM PRIORITY:` - Planned enhancements
  - `FUTURE:` - Long-term ideas
- **Benefits**: Easy scanning, clear priorities, manageable scope
- **Retirement**: Archive completed todos periodically to prevent list bloat

### Technical Growth Tracking
- **Current Comfort Level**: Learning developer with good instincts, responds well to detailed explanations with real-world analogies
- **Strong Areas**: 
  - Code structure and component architecture understanding
  - Asks clarifying questions when concepts are unclear
  - Good pattern recognition for UI/UX improvements
- **Growing Areas**: 
  - **React development workflow** - debugging when changes don't appear, hot reload, browser dev tools
  - **Development server lifecycle** - why we use localhost vs opening files directly
  - **System-level debugging** - connecting networking concepts to practical troubleshooting
- **Mastered Concepts**: 
  - **Networking fundamentals** - ports, processes, connection errors (excellent grasp!)
  - **Process analysis** - can read process output and understand system resources
  - **Real-world analogies** - consistently applies restaurant/apartment analogies correctly
  - React component structure and props
  - File organization and imports
  - Basic git workflow
- **Preferred Learning Style**:
  - **Real-world analogies** (restaurant, apartment building) work very well
  - **Step-by-step breakdowns** of technical processes
  - **Multiple examples** showing different scenarios (success vs error cases)
  - **"Why this matters"** explanations connecting concepts to practical development
- **Adaptation Signals Observed**:
  - ‚úÖ "explain this more" = wants deeper technical detail
  - ‚úÖ "i dont fully get it" = current explanation too high-level
  - ‚úÖ "give me similar explanations" = learning style working, wants consistency

### Effective Session Structure
- Start with context review and blockers
- Define clear success criteria
- Work in testable increments
- Document decisions immediately
- Update progress tracking files

### Problem-Solving Approach
- Understand constraints and dependencies first
- Consider multiple solutions with risk assessment
- Choose based on simplicity, maintainability, and performance
- Document why alternatives were rejected
- Always consider rollback procedures

### ASMIS-Specific Patterns
- Agent changes require parallel testing
- Database migrations need rollback procedures
- Performance baselines before any optimization
- Confidence scoring for all AI outputs
- Multi-tenant considerations for all features
