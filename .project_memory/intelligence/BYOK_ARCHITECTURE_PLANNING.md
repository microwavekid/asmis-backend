## Overview
This document analyzes architectural decisions needed to support user/tenant-owned API keys for LLMs in the future, with focus on which changes provide immediate benefits beyond just BYOK support. Based on research from OpenRouter, LiteLLM, and n8n implementations.

---

## Architectural Decisions Analysis

### 1. **Schema-Based Database Isolation** 
**BYOK Requirement:** Each tenant needs isolated data storage for API keys and usage tracking.

**Additional Benefits:**
- **Multi-tenant data security** - Prevents data leakage between customers
- **Compliance support** - Enables SOC 2, GDPR, and industry-specific requirements
- **Scalability** - Supports growth to thousands of tenants
- **Operational simplicity** - Easier backup, restore, and maintenance per tenant

**Recommendation:** **IMPLEMENT EARLY** - This aligns with our multi-tenant access control plan and provides immediate security/compliance benefits.

---

### 2. **Envelope Encryption for Key Storage**
**BYOK Requirement:** Secure storage of customer API keys with granular security control.

**Additional Benefits:**
- **Enhanced security posture** - Protects all sensitive data, not just API keys
- **Compliance readiness** - Meets encryption requirements for various regulations
- **Key rotation capabilities** - Enables automatic key rotation for all secrets
- **Audit trail** - Comprehensive logging of key access and usage

**Recommendation:** **IMPLEMENT EARLY** - Critical for overall security architecture and compliance.

---

### 3. **API Gateway with Intelligent Routing**
**BYOK Requirement:** Route requests to appropriate AI providers based on user keys and preferences.

**Additional Benefits:**
- **Performance optimization** - Route to fastest/cheapest providers
- **Reliability** - Automatic failover when providers are down
- **Cost optimization** - Intelligent provider selection based on usage patterns
- **Monitoring centralization** - Single point for all AI request monitoring
- **Rate limiting** - Per-tenant and per-user rate limiting
- **Caching** - Semantic and exact-match caching for cost reduction

**Recommendation:** **IMPLEMENT EARLY** - Provides immediate performance, reliability, and cost benefits.

---

### 4. **Hybrid Authentication (SAML 2.0 + OAuth 2.0/OIDC)**
**BYOK Requirement:** Enterprise SSO integration for API key management.

**Additional Benefits:**
- **Enterprise sales enablement** - Required for most enterprise deals
- **Security enhancement** - Multi-factor authentication and SSO
- **User experience** - Seamless authentication across web and API
- **Compliance** - Meets enterprise security requirements

**Recommendation:** **PLAN FOR LATER** - Important but not critical for current MVP. Implement when enterprise sales begin.

---

### 5. **Hybrid RBAC-ABAC Authorization Model**
**BYOK Requirement:** Granular access control for API key operations.

**Additional Benefits:**
- **Fine-grained permissions** - Control access to features, data, and operations
- **Compliance support** - Audit trails and access controls
- **Team collaboration** - Different permission levels for different roles
- **Security** - Principle of least privilege enforcement

**Recommendation:** **IMPLEMENT EARLY** - Critical for multi-tenant access control and security.

---

### 6. **Semantic Caching Architecture**
**BYOK Requirement:** Cost optimization through intelligent caching of similar requests.

**Additional Benefits:**
- **Cost reduction** - 30-80% cache hit rates reported
- **Performance improvement** - 5x speedup for long sequences
- **User experience** - Faster response times
- **Scalability** - Reduces load on AI providers

**Recommendation:** **IMPLEMENT EARLY** - Provides immediate cost and performance benefits.

---

### 7. **Circuit Breaker Patterns**
**BYOK Requirement:** Handle provider outages and rate limits gracefully.

**Additional Benefits:**
- **Reliability** - Prevents cascade failures
- **User experience** - Graceful degradation instead of complete failure
- **Monitoring** - Better visibility into provider health
- **Cost control** - Prevents excessive retries during outages

**Recommendation:** **IMPLEMENT EARLY** - Critical for production reliability.

---

### 8. **Usage Tracking and Cost Allocation**
**BYOK Requirement:** Track usage per tenant and user for billing and analytics.

**Additional Benefits:**
- **Business intelligence** - Understanding feature usage and value
- **Cost optimization** - Identify expensive operations and optimize
- **Customer insights** - Usage patterns and feature adoption
- **Revenue optimization** - Data-driven pricing decisions

**Recommendation:** **IMPLEMENT EARLY** - Provides immediate business value and cost visibility.
