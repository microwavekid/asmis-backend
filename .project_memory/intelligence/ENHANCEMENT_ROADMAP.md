# ASMIS Intelligence Enhancement Roadmap

## Overview
This document captures future enhancement ideas for the ASMIS meeting intelligence system, organized by priority and impact.

## Completed Enhancements âœ…
1. **MEDDPICC Structure Fix** - Corrected element names and structure
2. **Competition Inference Engine** - Solution-specific competitor detection
3. **MEDDPICC Completeness Scoring** - Multi-dimensional weighted scoring
4. **Stakeholder Relationship Mapping** - NetworkX influence analysis
5. **Risk Signal Detection** - 9-category early warning system

## High-Priority Enhancements ðŸ”´

### 1. Decision Criteria Extraction Accuracy
**Current Gap**: Limited extraction of specific evaluation criteria
**Enhancement**: 
- Pattern matching for requirement keywords
- Weighted criteria detection
- Priority/importance indicators
- Technical vs business criteria separation

### 2. Paper Process Intelligence
**Current Gap**: Basic process step extraction only
**Enhancement**:
- Legal review type detection (in-house vs 3rd party)
- Procurement complexity assessment
- Approval hierarchy mapping
- Compliance requirement identification
- Contract preference analysis
- Timeline prediction based on process complexity
**Details**: See `app/intelligence/paper_process_enhancement.md`

## Medium-Priority Enhancements ðŸŸ¡

### 3. Timeline Extraction & Analysis
**Current Gap**: Basic timeline mentions without structure
**Enhancement**:
- Date/deadline extraction with NLP
- Timeline confidence scoring
- Milestone mapping
- Critical path identification
- Delay risk indicators

### 4. Budget Range Detection
**Current Gap**: No numerical budget extraction
**Enhancement**:
- Price range detection algorithms
- Budget constraint indicators
- Funding source identification
- Payment term preferences
- Price sensitivity signals

### 5. Decision Process Visualization
**Current Gap**: Text-only process description
**Enhancement**:
- Visual decision flow diagrams
- Stakeholder approval paths
- Timeline overlay
- Bottleneck identification

## High-Priority UI/UX Enhancements ðŸ”´

### 6. Smart Capture Entity Handling Improvements
**Current Gaps**: 
- Entity linking breaks when punctuation follows entity mentions (e.g., "#Deal." loses highlighting)
- Missing dropdown selection for entity autocomplete 
- No automatic account selection when related entities are added
**Enhancement**:
- **Punctuation-tolerant entity linking**: Modify regex pattern to recognize entities followed by punctuation while keeping punctuation outside the pill
- **Autocomplete dropdown restoration**: Ensure typing "@Sar" shows dropdown with entity suggestions and Tab/click selection works
- **Smart account auto-selection**: When a deal or stakeholder belonging to an account is added, automatically select that account in dropdowns
**Impact**: Much more natural writing experience, reduces manual selection work
**Timeline**: Next development session

### 7. Multi-Source Evidence System
**Current Gap**: No way to verify AI-generated insights against source
**Enhancement**:
- Interactive evidence overlay for transcripts, documents, and emails
- Transcript evidence: timestamp navigation, speaker attribution
- Document evidence: page/section navigation, visual element handling (tables, charts)
- Email evidence: thread visualization, attachment handling
- Unified search across all evidence sources
- Direct navigation from any insight to original source
**Impact**: Complete evidence transparency, builds trust, enables rapid validation
**Details**: See `app/intelligence/evidence_overlay_enhancement.md` and `app/intelligence/multi_source_evidence_enhancement.md`
