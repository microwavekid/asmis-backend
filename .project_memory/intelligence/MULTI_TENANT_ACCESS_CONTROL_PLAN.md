# Multi-Tenant & User Access Control Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2025-06-30
**Status:** Planning & Required Architecture
**Priority:** CRITICAL (Data Security, Compliance, Scalability)

---

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan for implementing robust multi-tenant and user access control in the ASMIS backend. Early implementation is critical to ensure data security, compliance, and future scalability.

## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Add Tenant and User Ownership Fields to Models
- Add a `tenant_id` field to all major models: `Account`, `Deal`, `Document`, `Stakeholder`, etc.
- Ensure every record is associated with a tenant.
- Ensure ownership fields (`account_owner`, `deal_owner`, etc.) are present and used.

### 2. Update Database Migrations
- Create and apply migrations to add `tenant_id` columns to existing tables.
- Backfill existing data with the correct tenant IDs (if possible).

### 3. Update Relationships
- Ensure all relationships (e.g., deals to accounts, accounts to tenants) are properly linked via foreign keys.

### 4. Update API Endpoints
- For every API endpoint that fetches, updates, or deletes data:
  - Check that the requesting user's `tenant_id` matches the record's `tenant_id`.
  - Check that the user has the right permissions (e.g., is the owner or has access rights).

### 5. Enforce Access Control in Queries
- Update all database queries to filter by `tenant_id` and, where appropriate, by user ownership.

### 6. Update Authentication Logic
- Ensure that when a user logs in, their `tenant_id` is loaded and used for all subsequent requests.

### 7. Test Thoroughly
- Write tests to ensure users cannot access data from other tenants.
- Test edge cases (e.g., user tries to access a deal from another tenant).

### 8. Update Frontend (if needed)
- Make sure the frontend only displays data the user is allowed to see.

## Rationale
- **Data Security:** Prevents users from accessing data outside their organization.
- **Compliance:** Supports privacy and regulatory requirements.
- **Scalability:** Enables safe growth to multiple customers/tenants.
- **Technical Debt Avoidance:** Much easier to implement early than to retrofit later.
