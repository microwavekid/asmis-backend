# Tasks UI Enhancement - Account Executive Workflow Intelligence

**Date**: 2025-06-30
**Status**: Feature Specification (Ready for Implementation)
**Priority**: High (Core Account Executive Workflow)
**Pattern Applied**: STRATEGY_MODE_FEATURE_SPECIFICATION_PATTERN

## Vision Statement
Create a comprehensive task aggregation and execution system that enables account executives to review and act on all executable tasks across all accounts and deals, with intelligent AI automation and approval workflows.

## Strategic Context
The existing basic Tasks UI (`frontend-linear/app/tasks/page.tsx`) provides foundational task management with mock data. This enhancement transforms it into a mission-critical account executive productivity system that leverages ASMIS intelligence capabilities for automated task generation and execution.

## Current State vs Enhanced Vision

### Current Basic Tasks UI âœ…
- Individual task cards with completion/dismissal
- Basic filtering and grouping (effort, account, opportunity, due date, priority, type)
- Task details modal and completed tasks drawer
- Mock data with simple task properties

### Enhanced Account Executive Tasks UI ðŸŽ¯
- **Cross-account task aggregation** - All tasks across all accounts and deals in one interface
- **Multi-source task generation** - Human, AI-reactive, and AI-proactive task creation
- **Intelligent execution mechanisms** - Human, human-approved AI, and autonomous AI execution
- **AI autonomy decision framework** - Dynamic approval requirements based on task complexity and impact

## Feature Architecture

### Task Sources

#### 1. Human-Created Tasks
```typescript
interface HumanTask {
  source: "human";
  creator: string;
  manual_input: true;
  requires_approval: false;
}
```
- **Origin**: Manual creation by account executives or team members
- **Characteristics**: Standard task management, full human control
- **Examples**: "Schedule follow-up call", "Prepare demo materials", "Research competitor pricing"

#### 2. AI-Reactive Tasks
```typescript
interface AIReactiveTask {
  source: "ai_reactive";
  trigger_event: "transcript_analysis" | "email_analysis" | "meeting_analysis";
  confidence_score: number; // 0.0-1.0
  evidence_sources: string[];
  requires_approval: boolean; // Based on confidence + impact
}
```
- **Origin**: Generated from analysis of transcripts, emails, meetings
- **Trigger Examples**:
  - Transcript analysis reveals unaddressed concern â†’ "Follow up on security questions"
  - Meeting notes show missed action item â†’ "Send pricing proposal as promised"
  - Email thread indicates new stakeholder â†’ "Research new contact background"

#### 3. AI-Proactive Tasks
```typescript
interface AIProactiveTask {
  source: "ai_proactive";
  generation_type: "campaign_based" | "pattern_analysis" | "risk_mitigation";
  cross_account_patterns: boolean;
  strategic_value: "high" | "medium" | "low";
  requires_approval: true; // Default true for proactive suggestions
}
```
- **Origin**: AI analysis of cross-account patterns, campaign optimization, risk signals
- **Generation Examples**:
  - **Campaign-based**: "Similar deals in healthcare require security certification" â†’ "Initiate SOC2 discussion"
  - **Pattern analysis**: "Deals with similar profiles convert 80% better with executive demo" â†’ "Schedule C-level presentation"
  - **Risk mitigation**: "Timeline slipping in 3 similar deals" â†’ "Validate project timeline assumptions"

### Execution Mechanisms

#### 1. Human-Executed Tasks
```typescript
interface HumanExecution {
  execution_type: "human";
  assignee: string;
  completion_tracking: "manual";
  ai_assistance_available: boolean;
}
```
- **Control**: Full human control over execution
- **Tracking**: Manual status updates, completion confirmation
- **AI Support**: Optional AI suggestions for email templates, talking points, research summaries

#### 2. Human-Approved AI-Executed Tasks
```typescript
interface HumanApprovedAIExecution {
  execution_type: "ai_with_approval";
  approval_required_from: string[];
  ai_execution_plan: ExecutionPlan;
  preview_mode: boolean;
  rollback_capability: boolean;
}
```
- **Workflow**: AI generates execution plan â†’ Human reviews/approves â†’ AI executes â†’ Human confirms
- **Examples**:
  - AI drafts follow-up email â†’ Human approves â†’ AI sends â†’ Human notified
  - AI schedules meeting â†’ Human confirms attendees â†’ AI sends invites â†’ Human tracks
  - AI updates CRM â†’ Human reviews changes â†’ AI commits â†’ Human validates

#### 3. Autonomous AI-Executed Tasks
```typescript
interface AutonomousAIExecution {
  execution_type: "autonomous";
  safety_constraints: SafetyConstraints;
  automatic_reporting: boolean;
  intervention_triggers: string[];
  confidence_threshold: number; // Must exceed threshold for autonomous execution
}
```
- **Criteria**: Low-risk, high-confidence, well-defined task patterns
- **Examples**:
  - Research publicly available company information
  - Schedule internal preparation meetings
  - Update deal status based on predefined triggers
  - Generate standard reports and summaries

### AI Autonomy Decision Framework

#### Decision Matrix
```typescript
interface AutonomyDecisionCriteria {
  task_complexity: "low" | "medium" | "high";
  external_impact: "none" | "internal" | "customer_facing";
  financial_risk: "none" | "low" | "medium" | "high";
  confidence_score: number; // 0.0-1.0
  precedent_success_rate: number; // Historical success for similar tasks
  reversibility: boolean; // Can the action be easily undone?
}
```

#### Autonomy Rules
1. **Autonomous Execution Allowed**:
   - Low complexity + No external impact + High confidence (>0.9) + High precedent success (>0.85)
   - Research tasks with no customer interaction
   - Internal scheduling and preparation

2. **Approval Required**:
   - Customer-facing communications
   - Financial commitments or pricing discussions
   - High-complexity analysis or recommendations
   - New task patterns with limited precedent

3. **Human Only**:
   - Strategic decision making
   - Sensitive relationship management
   - High-stakes negotiations
   - Creative problem solving
