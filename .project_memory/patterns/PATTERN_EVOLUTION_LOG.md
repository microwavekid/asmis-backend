## 2025-07-05 — Log Created
- **Pattern:** ALL
- **Change:** Created pattern evolution log and instituted requirement to log all pattern updates, replacements, and major changes.
- **Rationale:** To ensure traceability, collaboration, and adherence to best practices. Pattern evolution must be visible to all contributors and agents.
- **Reference:** NEURAL_IMPRINT.json, Working Patterns update

## Log Format
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Pattern:** Pattern file or ID
- **Change:** Summary of what changed
- **Rationale:** Why the change was made
- **Reference:** Related decision, session, or issue

## 2025-07-10 — Hybrid Stub-First Pattern Created
- **Pattern:** HYBRID_STUB_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN
- **Change:** Created new architectural pattern for large-scale implementation projects
- **Rationale:** Discovered need for early integration testing during MIC-45 multi-tenancy implementation. Hybrid approach provides early feedback while maintaining solid foundations.

## 2025-07-12 — Pattern Myelination via IMPROVE Command
- **Pattern:** MEMORY_SYSTEM_NAVIGATION_PATTERN
- **Change:** Increased pattern weight from 1.0 to 1.15 (15% boost)
- **Rationale:** Pattern showed 12 successful uses in current session with high effectiveness
- **Reference:** IMPROVE command execution, proposal REM-2025-07-12-001

---

## 2025-07-12 — Command Implementation Pattern Created
- **Pattern:** COMMAND_IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERN
- **Change:** Created new pattern for systematic reserved command execution
- **Rationale:** Identified gap in pattern coverage for implementing behavioral commands like REMEMBER/IMPROVE
- **Reference:** IMPROVE command execution, proposal REM-2025-07-12-002

---

## 2025-07-12 — Sync Status Conflict Detection Pattern Created
- **Pattern:** SYNC_STATUS_CONFLICT_DETECTION_PATTERN
- **Change:** Created comprehensive sync status tracking and conflict detection system
- **Rationale:** Support hybrid Linear/cache architecture with sophisticated conflict resolution
- **Reference:** Hybrid architecture implementation, performance optimization initiative

---

## 2025-07-12 — Progressive Enhancement UX Pattern Created
- **Pattern:** PROGRESSIVE_ENHANCEMENT_UX_PATTERN
- **Change:** Created visual and textual indicators for progressive enhancement user experience
- **Rationale:** Provide clear visibility into data freshness, sync status, and performance states
- **Reference:** Hybrid architecture UX optimization, user transparency requirements
