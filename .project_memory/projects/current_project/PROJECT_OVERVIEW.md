# Epic Overview: ASMIS Project Intelligence Automation System

## Overview
**Goal**: Implement and validate an intelligent, interactive system for maintaining project context and learning through automated git hooks and smart prompting.
**Strategic Importance**: This automation system serves as the foundation for maintaining project intelligence across all future development work. It ensures that architectural decisions, patterns, and progress are consistently captured and accessible.
**Timeline**: 1 Week (completed)
**Status**: âœ… Implementation Complete - In Validation Phase

## Success Criteria
- [x] Interactive post-commit hook implemented with smart prompting
- [x] Location-aware scripts that work from any directory
- [x] Automatic timestamp updates on every commit
- [x] Decision logging with interactive prompts
- [x] Task completion tracking with automatic updates
- [x] Pattern documentation suggestions
- [x] Epic alignment checks
- [x] Non-blocking design that enhances developer workflow
- [x] Color-coded output for better user experience
- [x] Comprehensive testing and validation

## Technical Approach
Implemented a git hook system with:
- **Pre-commit hook**: Automatic timestamp updates and context file management
- **Post-commit hook**: Interactive prompting for decisions, patterns, and task completion
- **Location-aware scripts**: Self-discovery architecture for robust operation
- **tput-based color output**: Portable terminal formatting across environments

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Dependencies**: Git hooks, Python scripts, shell compatibility
- **Risks**: Hook conflicts with other tools, user adoption
- **Mitigation**: Non-blocking design, comprehensive testing, clear documentation

## Progress Tracking
- See `.project_memory/progress/todo_tracker.md` for task-level detail
- See `DECISIONS_LOG.md` for architectural decisions
- See `sessions/active_session.md` for current work session

## Next Epic: Database Schema Design
**Planned Start**: After validation of current automation system
**Goal**: Design and implement robust, scalable database architecture for ASMIS platform
**Status**: Queued for next development phase
