# Epic Overview: ASMIS Foundational Database Architecture

## Overview
**Goal**: Design and implement a robust, scalable, and secure database architecture that will serve as the foundation for the entire ASMIS platform.
**Strategic Importance**: This is the core infrastructure project. A well-designed schema will enable all future application features, from prompt management to multi-tenant analytics and advanced intelligence capabilities.
**Timeline**: 2 Weeks (of 6 for total project)
**Status**: In Design Phase

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Schema supports multi-tenancy and secure data isolation.
- [ ] Schema supports data ownership (users, deals, accounts).
- [ ] Storage patterns for transcripts, vectors, documents, and configurations are defined and implemented.
- [ ] Data relationship models (e.g., parent/child deals) are established.
- [ ] The schema is flexible enough to support the upcoming Prompt Management feature.
- [ ] An initial migration plan using Alembic is drafted.

## Technical Approach
Starting with PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and JSON support. Schema will normalize prompt metadata while storing content as JSONB for flexibility. Planning for Redis cache layer from the start to meet performance requirements.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Blocking**: Schema design blocks all downstream work
- **Risks**: Over-engineering the schema vs. being too restrictive
- **Mitigation**: Start simple, plan for migrations
