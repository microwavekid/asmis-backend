# Adaptive MEDDPICC Question Intelligence Enhancement

## Overview
Self-improving AI question recommendation system that learns from meeting outcomes to continuously optimize sales methodology execution. This system suggests contextually-appropriate questions for each MEDDPICC element and evolves based on measured effectiveness in actual sales conversations.

## Core Innovation
Transform static sales methodology into an adaptive, learning system that:
- Recommends optimal questions based on deal context and MEDDPICC gaps
- Learns from transcript analysis which questions generate valuable responses
- Evolves question strategies based on deal outcomes (win/loss)
- Personalizes recommendations for rep style and customer type
- Integrates with strategic plays and campaign orchestration
