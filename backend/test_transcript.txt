Sarah (CFO): We need to improve our conversion rates by 30% before Q4. This is a critical metric for our business.

John (VP Sales): I have $75K budget approved for this initiative. We need to make sure we get the right solution.

Mike (IT Director): The solution must integrate with our existing Salesforce instance. That's non-negotiable.

John: I'll champion this internally. Our main pain point is cart abandonment - we're losing about 25% of potential sales there.

Sarah: The decision will be made by the end of this month. We need to see ROI within 6 months.

Mike: We'll need to evaluate the technical requirements carefully. Security and scalability are key decision criteria.

John: I've already spoken with the economic buyer, and they're aligned with our budget. We just need to finalize the requirements.

Sarah: Make sure to document all the metrics we discussed. We'll need to track progress against these KPIs.
