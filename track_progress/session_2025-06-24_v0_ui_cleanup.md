# Session: 2025-06-24 - v0 UI Cleanup & Routing Fix

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Resolved v0 Dev Server Issue
- **Issue**: 404 error on root route
- **Root Cause**: Missing `page.tsx` in app directory
- **Solution**: Created root page with redirect to `/dashboard` → `/deals`
- **Pattern Applied**: FRONTEND_ROUTING_PATTERN
- **Decision**: DEC_2025-06-24_001, DEC_2025-06-24_002

### 2. Identified Old vs New UI Conflict
- **Discovery**: Project had both old traditional UI and new v0 intelligence UI
- **Old UI**: Traditional dashboard at `/dashboard`, `/accounts`, etc.
- **New v0 UI**: Modern intelligence-focused UI in `/(intelligence)/` directory
- **Key Differences**:
  - Old: Traditional sidebar layout
  - New: Three-panel layout with AI features, evidence panel, command palette

### 3. Cleaned Up Old UI Files
- **Removed**:
  - Old page directories: dashboard, accounts, emails, tasks, documents, admin
  - Old component directories: layout, dashboard
  - Deprecated mock data in lib/deprecated
  - Old layout.tsx with AppSidebar
- **Created**: New minimal root layout.tsx
- **Decision**: DEC_2025-06-24_003

### 4. Fixed Navigation Routes
- **Issue**: Navigation links pointed to `/intelligence/*` but pages were at root
- **Fixed**: Updated all navigation hrefs from `/intelligence/X` to `/X`
- **Current State**:
  - ✅ `/deals` page exists and works
  - ❌ Other pages don't exist yet (expected for v0 prototype)

## 📊 Current Project State

### Frontend Structure
```
frontend/app/
├── (intelligence)/          # New v0 UI with route group
│   ├── deals/              # ✅ Implemented
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   └── layout.tsx          # Modern three-panel layout
├── layout.tsx              # Minimal root layout
├── page.tsx                # Redirects to /deals
└── globals.css             # Includes design-system.css
```

### Active Features in v0 UI
- WorkspaceSelector
- NavigationMenu (with corrected routes)
- AIProcessingStatus
- EvidencePanel
- CommandPalette (Cmd+K)
- Modern Linear-inspired design system

## 🎯 Next Steps (When Returning)
1. **Complete MEDDPICC card components with evidence display** (Priority: High)
2. **Implement backend-frontend integration for deal intelligence** (Priority: High)
3. **Consider creating placeholder pages** for other routes
4. **Add timeline extraction from transcripts** (Priority: Medium)
5. **Add budget range detection capabilities** (Priority: Medium)

## 📋 Key Decisions Made
- Chose to make v0 intelligence UI the primary interface
- Removed all old UI code to avoid confusion
- Fixed routing to use root-level paths instead of /intelligence prefix

## 🔧 Technical Notes
- Dev server runs on standard Next.js setup (no special v0 server)
- Project name "my-v0-project" is just the scaffold name
- All v0 UI components properly integrated with shadcn/ui
- Frontend ready for backend integration
