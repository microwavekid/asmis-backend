# ASMIS Fix & Progress Tracker

## üö® CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE
- [x] Fix Anthropic client initialization error
  - [x] Check meeting_intelligence_agent.py __init__ method
  - [x] Check document_intelligence_agent.py __init__ method  
  - [x] Check action_items_agent.py __init__ method
  - [x] Check stakeholder_intelligence_agent.py __init__ method
  - [x] Verify AsyncAnthropic(api_key=api_key) - NO extra parameters
  - [x] Test health check shows all agents as "healthy"

## üìã INTEGRATION TASKS COMPLETED
- [x] Added StakeholderIntelligenceAgent import to orchestrator
- [x] Added agent initialization in _initialize_agents()
- [x] Added configuration "extract_stakeholder_intelligence": True
- [x] Added stakeholder processing to _extract_intelligence() method
- [x] Added results processing for stakeholder intelligence
- [x] Added stakeholder_agent to health_check method
- [x] Fixed KeyError in health_check by fully integrating the agent

## üß™ TESTING TASKS
- [x] Test root-level migration task
- [x] Fix client initialization errors
- [x] Run test_system.py successfully
- [x] Verify stakeholder intelligence extraction works
- [x] Confirm cost-effective architecture (3 API calls total)
- [x] Validate parallel processing working
- [x] Enhance test_system.py for better agent status reporting

## üîß AUTOMATION SETUP
- [x] Create progress tracking files (todo_tracker.md, context_recovery.md)
- [x] Set up git hooks for automatic progress tracking
- [x] Create update_progress.py script for manual updates
- [ ] Test git hooks with a commit
- [ ] Document progress tracking workflow
- [x] .git/hooks/post-commit (created)
- [x] scripts/update_progress.py (created)
- [x] backend/test_system.py (enhanced reporting)

## ‚ö° PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED
- [x] Investigated system performance (original: 10.05s, optimized: 8.75s)
- [x] Confirmed parallel processing architecture working correctly
- [x] Added detailed timing logs for performance monitoring
- [x] Implemented content preprocessing for efficiency
- [x] Tested and reverted quality-reducing changes
- [x] Preserved enterprise-grade analysis with confidence scores and evidence
- [x] Determined 9.39s processing time acceptable for background analysis

## üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED
- [x] Reviewed existing database design documents and patterns
- [x] Confirmed PostgreSQL selection and architectural patterns
- [x] Identified implementation gap - zero actual database code exists
- [x] Located comprehensive architectural patterns in .project_memory/patterns/
- [x] Reviewed active database design session from 2024-12-17
- [x] Set up database dependencies (SQLAlchemy, Alembic, asyncpg, greenlet)
- [x] Created database configuration and connection management
- [x] Designed and implemented initial schema (prompts, templates, versions, sessions)
- [x] Created SQLAlchemy models for core entities with proper relationships
- [x] Set up Alembic for database migrations (simplified sync version)
- [x] Created repository pattern implementation with full CRUD operations
- [x] Wrote and executed successful database layer tests
- [x] Generated and applied initial database migration
- [x] Verified database functionality with comprehensive test suite

## üîí SECURITY & VALIDATION IMPROVEMENTS
- [x] Removed hardcoded credentials from configuration files
- [x] Added comprehensive environment variable validation with fail-fast
- [x] Created .env.example template for secure configuration
- [x] Updated .gitignore to protect database files and secrets
- [x] Implemented production vs development environment handling
- [x] Added DATABASE_SETUP.md documentation for proper deployment
- [x] Validated security improvements with test suite

## üìã FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: Migrate to async PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Implement custom exception classes for better error handling
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add pytest-based test suite with negative test cases
- [ ] **LOW**: Add caching layer for frequently accessed data

**PROGRESS UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS**: 
- Mark completed tasks with [x]
- Add timestamp when completing tasks
- Add notes for any issues encountered
- Update this file after EVERY task completion

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-22 15:45:00
**Current Status**: Database implementation completed with security improvements! Removed hardcoded credentials, added environment validation, and proper documentation. Production-ready database layer with fail-fast validation now operational. Ready for async enhancement or next development phase.
